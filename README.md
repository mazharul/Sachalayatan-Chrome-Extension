Sachalayatan Google chrome extension.
Fetching the latest sachalayatan blog posts.

##TO-DO

1. Get rid of feedburner, get the rss feed directly and parse it through jquery to serve it in popup.html (this way we can control the visualization of feed).
2. Proper HTML markup of the plugin.

(This version of the extension is not pushed to webstore yet!)
